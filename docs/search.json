    "text": "Washington’s coasts are home to an incredibly diverse suite of beach habitats. These habitats are among the most vulnerable to climate change due to sea level rise, with predicted increases of up to 10-12 inches by 2050 (NOAA). 1/3 of all Puget Sound shorelines have been modified, with around 90% modified within Seattle city boundaries (Weitkamp et al., 2000)\nIt is essential to understand how vulnerable these ecosystems and the organisms who inhabit them are to climate change and shoreline development. In order to do this, we need to look at organisms whose survival is intrinsically linked to the health of these ecosystems. One such organism is:"

    "text": "Spatio-temporal variation in spawning\nWithin the Washington State Waters, surf smelt spawning can be observed almost year-round, with high frequencies of spawning activity in the Summer (July/August) and Winter (November/December). Peaks in spawning activity differ by region, with Puget Sound fish appearing to spawn predominantly in the Winter months, Outer Coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca fish in the Summer, while Skagit Bay and San Juan Islands fish spawn year round.\nEnvironmental conditions wildly across the spawning range of surf smelt at different times of the year. Factors including dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, and wave action could all influence when and where fish spawn as well as egg the survival of those spawns. The underlying mechanism for this behavioral plasticity is not well understood, but drastic differences in spawning conditions may be evidence of temporal reproductive isolation in Washington surf smelt populations."

Picture courtesy of Mark Tagal\n\n\nSurf smelt deposit their eggs in the upper intertidal zone of marine and estuarine beaches during high tide. The eggs attach to sediment grains and remain unsubmerged for about two weeks until the next high tide flushes the larvae into the water. This dry incubation is essential for egg survival, potentially preventing fungal infections.\n\nSpatio-temporal Variation in Spawning\nWithin Washington State waters, surf smelt spawn nearly year-round, with activity peaks in summer (July–August) and winter (November–December). Regional patterns differ:\n\nPuget Sound: Predominantly winter spawning\nOuter Coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca: Predominantly summer spawning\nSkagit Bay and San Juan Islands: Year-round spawning\n\n\n\n\nSurf Smelt spawning detection frequency in Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. The color of each hexagon represents the frequency of positive surf smelt egg detections out of the total number of sampling trips. Winter sampling from October to February is shown on the left and Summer sampling from May to September is shown on the right. Data from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Forage Fish Spawning Database.\n\n\nEnvironmental variables—dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, and wave action—vary across regions and seasons. Such variability may drive behavioral plasticity or temporal reproductive isolation among Washington surf smelt populations."

    "section": "Vulnerability",
    "text": "Vulnerability\nSurf smelt depend on healthy intertidal habitats for reproduction. One of the biggest threats to the intertidal zone is a phenomenon known as coastal squeeze. When artificial shorelines such as seawalls are built, they halt the natural resupply of sediment via backshore erosion. As the tide continues wash away sediment from the beach there is no new sediment to replace it, resulting in a flattening of the beach profile. Pairing this with sea level rise means that the intertidal zone continually shrinks with rising sea levels, eventually leading to a total loss of intertidal habitat. This would result in a catastrophic decline in surf smelt populations, which would have cascading effects on the entire marine ecosystem."

Using this data we will analyze population structure and look for genomic islands of divergence that may result from selective pressures or structural variation in the genome. This will help us understand how surf smelt populations have adapted to their environments and how they may respond to future changes.\n\n\nSpawning Habitat Surveys\nUsing the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Forage Fish Spawning Database, we will identify beaches with high spawning activity at different times of year. Field measurements at these sites will include sediment grain size, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and wave action. Integrating environmental and genetic data will help identify adaptive strategies used by surf smelt to cope with seasonal habitat variability."
